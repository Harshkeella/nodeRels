"""SQLite store for chat sessions and messages.

App state, deliberately kept out of the knowledge graph and the vector store:
a session list is a mutable, per-user, chronological thing, and neither
NetworkX-on-disk nor Qdrant is the right shape for it. Same aiosqlite pattern
and same storage dir as `manifest.py`, a separate file so a knowledge-base
rebuild (which deletes storage/kb) never takes the chat history with it.

The evidence chain persisted on an assistant message is the JSON returned by
the retrieval pipeline, stored verbatim -- that is what makes a provenance
panel still work when an old session is reopened.
